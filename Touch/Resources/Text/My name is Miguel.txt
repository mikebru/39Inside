My name is Miguel. Before coming north, I was in Monterrey, my brother called and asked me if I wanted to join him in the United States. I said yes, and that made me very happy because that would mean a better life for me, for all of us. The bus from Monterrey to Laredo wasn’t too bad. There I met the coyote that my brother had arranged for me. That day, in the evening, several of us walked with the coyote, we walked a lot, and then we crossed the river. I realized that we were already in the United States and that made me really happy.
