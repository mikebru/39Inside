. 
My name is Lucia.. 

I am 17.. 

I am naked, completely wet..
 
My clothes are in a plastic bag that I am holding on my right hand.. 

I am cold.. 

I just crossed the river, I need to get dressed soon to continue my way to Austin.. 

I don’t know his name.. 

He is also naked, but he is getting dressed already..
 
I only know he is the coyote my sister paid to get me across the river.. 

Afterall, it seems like it wasn’t that hard, I am on US soil already.. 

The truth is, it doesn’t feel any different, let’s see what is next.

I hope everything goes well..

Although, I know that..

I will always be a foreigner, after all.
